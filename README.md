 Developed a Python-based tool to analyze and recognize users' emotional states in real time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Trained a new model on a public dataset from kaggle, to gain the experience of testing the fine tuning my results.
 Leveraged OpenCV for facial feature detection and a convolutional neural network to classify emotions into distinct categories such as happiness, sadness, and anger. The program processes video input, providing dynamic feedback on emotional trends and patterns. 
 Designed for applications in user experience analysis.
